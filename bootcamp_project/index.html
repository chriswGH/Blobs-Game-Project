    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Blob game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates an extensive understanding of loops, groups, and interaction. I created a game using circles (blobs) that were created using an array list. These blobs are randomly placed around the canvas. The player controls a much larger blob and uses their mouse to move the blob. The aim of this game is for the player to "eat" all of the other blobs by passing through them, increasing in size. I also added some quality of life additions by altering the zoom (scope) of the canvas based on the current size of the player's blob.
